# Virtual Reality Application

The goal of this project is to combine augmented reality, puzzles, and music to provide the senior population with an interactive way to perform physical exercises. Participants complete challenges to earn puzzle pieces and music snippets, with the ultimate task of putting the snippets by order and then guessing the song.
